# Rain-or-Shine

## Description

In this challenge, I was supposed to learn how to do a future forecast but was only able to do the current one. I struggled through this assignment so I am sorry.

The purpose was to show the current and future forecasts for a given city as well as use localStorage and other icons to save the weather information.

## Installation

Modified HTML, CSS, and JS scripts for the exercise.

Called certain API's for current and future weather.

Completed code pushed to GitHub.

GitPages used for deployed website.

## Usage

The end user should be able to get current weather information.
